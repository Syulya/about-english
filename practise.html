            Writing is a medium of human communication that represents language and emotion through the inscription or recording of signs and symbols. 
            In most languages, writing is a complement to speech or spoken language. Writing is not a language but a form of technology. Within a language system,
            writing relies on many of the same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols, 
            usually in the form of a formal alphabet.
